# MCP Dual-Cycle Reasoner

[![CI](https://github.com/cyqlelabs/mcp-dual-cycle-reasoner/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/cyqlelabs/mcp-dual-cycle-reasoner/actions/workflows/ci.yml)

A Model Context Protocol (MCP) server implementing the **Dual-Cycle Metacognitive Reasoning Framework** for autonomous agents. This tool empowers agents with greater self-awareness and reliability through intelligent loop detection and experience acquisition.

## Description

The MCP Dual-Cycle Reasoner is a sophisticated tool designed to enhance the autonomy and reliability of AI agents. By implementing a dual-cycle metacognitive framework, it provides agents with the ability to monitor their own cognitive processes, detect when they are stuck in repetitive loops, and learn from past experiences to make better decisions.

The framework consists of two main components:

- **Sentinel**: Monitors the agent's actions and detects anomalies, such as action repetition, state invariance, and progress stagnation.
- **Adjudicator**: Manages a case base of past experiences, allowing the agent to store and retrieve solutions to previously encountered problems.

This server is built with TypeScript and leverages high-performance libraries for statistical analysis, natural language processing, and semantic similarity, enabling advanced features like entropy-based anomaly detection, NLI-based text analysis, and intelligent case management.

## Key Features

- ðŸ“Š **Advanced Statistical Analysis**: Entropy-based anomaly detection and time series analysis.
- ðŸ§  **Enhanced Case-Based Reasoning**: Semantic similarity matching with NLI-based text analysis.
- ðŸŽ¯ **Multi-Strategy Detection**: Statistical, pattern-based, and hybrid loop detection.
- ðŸ“ˆ **Time Series Analysis**: Trend detection and cyclical pattern recognition.
- ðŸ”§ **Configurable Detection**: Domain-specific thresholds and progress indicators.
- ðŸŽ¨ **Intelligent Case Management**: Quality scoring, deduplication, and usage-based optimization.
- ðŸš€ **High-Performance Libraries**: Built with `simple-statistics`, `natural`, `compromise`, and HuggingFace Transformers.

### Using with Claude Desktop

Add the following to your Claude Desktop MCP configuration:

```json

## Example Usage Scenario

## Example Usage Scenario

Here's a complete example showing how to use the dual-cycle reasoner to monitor an autonomous agent and build up experience over time:

### 1. Initial Setup and Configuration

```typescript
// Configure detection parameters for your domain
await configure_detection({
  progress_indicators: ['page_loaded', 'form_submitted', 'data_extracted'],
  min_actions_for_detection: 3,
  alternating_threshold: 0.6,
  repetition_threshold: 0.3,
  semantic_intents: [
    'navigating to page',
    'clicking element',
    'filling form field',
    'submitting form',
    'validating input',
    'handling popup',
    'extracting data',
    'waiting for response',
  ],
});

// Start monitoring the agent's goal
await start_monitoring({
  goal: 'Complete user registration process on website',
});
```

### 2. Monitoring Agent Actions

```typescript
// Monitor each action the agent takes
await process_trace_update({
  last_action: 'click_signup_button',
  current_context: 'homepage',
  goal: 'Complete user registration process on website',
});

// ... agent continues actions ...

// Agent gets stuck clicking submit repeatedly
await process_trace_update({
  last_action: 'click_submit_button',
  current_context: 'registration_form',
  goal: 'Complete user registration process on website',
});
// Returns: {
//   "intervention_required": true,
//   "loop_detected": {
//     "detected": true,
//     "type": "action_repetition",
//     "confidence": 0.85,
//     "details": "Loop detected via parameter_repetition: 57% anomaly score...",
//     "actions_involved": ["click_submit_button"]
//   }
// }
```

### 3. Storing and Retrieving Experiences

```typescript
// Store a successful experience
await store_experience({
  problem_description: 'Email validation error blocking form submission',
  solution: 'Check email format and retry with valid email address',
  outcome: true,
  context: 'registration_form',
  difficulty_level: 'medium',
});

// When a loop is detected, retrieve similar cases for recovery
const similarCases = await retrieve_similar_cases({
  problem_description: 'Form submission button not responding to clicks',
  max_results: 3,
  context_filter: 'registration_form',
  outcome_filter: true,
});
```

## Understanding Loop Detection

When the `process_trace_update` tool detects a potential loop, it returns a detailed `loop_detected` object. Understanding the components of this object can help you diagnose and debug agent behavior.

Here's a quick guide to the key metrics:

- **`anomaly score`**: An overall score (0-100%) representing the confidence that the agent's recent actions are part of a loop. It's a weighted average of multiple detection methods.
- **`confidence`**: The final confidence score (0.0-1.0) that a loop has been detected. It is derived from the `anomaly score`.
- **`Semantic`**: The percentage of recent actions that are semantically similar to each other (e.g., `click_button_A` and `click_button_B`).
- **`Parameter`**: The percentage of similarity between the parameters of semantically similar actions.
- **`Exact`**: The percentage of recent actions that are exact, character-for-character duplicates.
- **`Cyclical`**: The score (0-100%) indicating the presence of repeating sequences of actions (e.g., A, B, C, A, B, C).

The `details` string also contains two important metrics:

- **`(X/Y actions involved)`**: Shows how many of the last Y actions were identified as being part of the detected loop.
- **`(X/Y methods agreed)`**: Indicates how many of the three primary detection strategies (`Action Anomalies`, `State Invariance`, `Progress Stagnation`) agreed that a loop was present.
